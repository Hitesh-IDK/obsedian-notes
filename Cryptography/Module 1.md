#### Cryptography

Characteristics or Characterization of cryptographic systems,
- Operation used for transforming plaintext to ciphertext - (Substitution & Transposition)
- The number of keys used - (Symmetric or single key or secret key and Asymmetric or two-key or public key)
- The way in which plain text is processed - (Block cipher & Stream cipher)
