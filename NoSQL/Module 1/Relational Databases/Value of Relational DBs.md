- **Persistent Data Storage**: Relational databases efficiently store large amounts of persistent data, allowing quick and easy access to small parts of that data. They provide more flexibility than traditional file systems, especially in enterprise applications.
  
- **Concurrency Management**: Relational databases handle multiple users accessing and modifying the same data simultaneously through transactions, which help manage errors and ensure consistency, preventing issues like double booking.

- **Integration**: Databases enable collaboration between multiple applications by allowing them to share data in a common space, simplifying inter-application data sharing and coordination.

- **Standardization**: Relational databases follow a mostly standardized model, making it easier for developers and professionals to apply their knowledge across different database systems, despite minor variations in SQL dialects and transaction mechanisms.
