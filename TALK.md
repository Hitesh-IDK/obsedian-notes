Phases of AI Agents
- Phase 1 - Limited context window / tokens
- Phase 2 - Increased context window, supports documents and other files
- Phase 3 - RAGS and Tool Use - Retrieval Augmented Generatior (RAGs) for accessing up to date information. Tools like APIs for enhanced results
- Phase 4 - Multi Modal Workflow - Support images, audio and video for input as well as output. Real time data can be used as an input - example asking the description of the image taken in real time
- Phase 5 - Current AI Agent Architecture - currently most popular architecture for this is ReACT framework
